# IoMBian Button Handler

This service checks the state of a momentary button connected to a GPIO pin and publishes the informacion through a ZeroMQ socket (port 5556 by default).

The event list is:

- Single click: "click"
- Double click: "double_click"
- Triple click: "triple_click"
- Many click (more than 3): "many_click"
- Long click (more than 1 sec): "long_click"
- Long long click (more than 5 secs): "long_long_click"

Any ZeroMQ subscriber can listen to those events and act acordingly.
